## 5001 final
Just a small project for 5001. We had around a month to actually work on this, in addition to other assignments. It is pretty barebones, but it has a simple GUI and performs the basic functions one would assume present in bill tracking
- Uses a sqlite3 database to store the bills
- has a few classes to deal with commonly used functions, Search, Database, and a GUI class
- under the unittesting directory there is a tests.py file that you can run all the tests from at once, with verbose output
  - Some do not have tests because they are tested through other unit tests
- Written pretty much entirely in python. It does have a requirements.txt but I think most of those are remnants from when i started it with the intention of using flask
